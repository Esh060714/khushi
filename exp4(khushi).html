                    <h2>What is Sketching?</h2>
                  <p>Sketching is an artistic practice that involves making quick, freehand drawings that capture the essence, form, or idea of a subject. Unlike more detailed and polished artworks, sketches are often rough and unfinished, serving as a visual shorthand for the artist's observations, thoughts, or preliminary plans. This versatile technique can be used in various fields, from fine arts.

<p>The beauty of sketching lies in its simplicity and accessibility. While digital tools have become increasingly popular, traditional sketching materials remain timeless and beloved by many artists.
</p>

<li>Pencils: Graphite pencils, ranging from hard (H) to soft (B), are staple tools for sketching. Each grade offers different levels of darkness and texture, allowing for versatility in shading and detailing.

</li>
    <li>Charcoal: Charcoal sticks and pencils create rich, deep blacks and offer a wide range of tonal values. They are ideal for expressive and dramatic sketches.

</li>
    <li>Ink: Ink pens and brushes provide precision and boldness. Techniques like stippling and cross-hatching can be effectively executed with ink.

</li>
    <li>Paper: The choice of paper can significantly impact a sketch. Smooth paper is excellent for fine detail, while textured paper adds depth and character to the drawing.
